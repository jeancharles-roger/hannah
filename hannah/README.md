Hannah
======

Hannah is a library that proposes a simple API for incremental code generators. 
It aims to be a powerful back-end for code generators that needs incremental generation and user intervention on generated code.
It provides the merge of user modification inside generated code using a Git repository.

Version
=======

Hannah is under development and is mostly just an idea with successful experiments using Git.
It will need work before being functional.

TODO
====

* Creates a complete set of tests.
* Add API and callbacks for conflict handling.
* Experiment on file suppressed by generation.
* Check how the Git repository can be transported by another SCM manager.

Licence

Hannah is distributed under the GLPv3 licence.
